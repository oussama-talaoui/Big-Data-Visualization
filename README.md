## About the Practical Work
The objective of this practical work is to put into practice the concepts learnt
during the theory classes and to get proficiency in the use of some tools that will allow us to
interactively analyze a set of data. Furthermore, we will be able to develop our own tools
to conduct this kind of analysis.

The practical work consists in the following exercises:

## First exercise: Shiny Tutorial


- [X] Installation and configuration of the tools needed to accomplish the practical work: R, RStudio, Shiny
- [X] Introduction to Shiny
- [X] Structure and GUI of apps developed with Shiny
- [X] Addition of new interactive controls
- [X] Interactive visualization of data
- [X] R scripting
- [X] Reactive expressions with Shiny
- [ ] Sharing applications
  - [x] Sharing the Shiny app as R scripts
  - [ ] Sharing the Shiny app as a web page
- [X] Review of some examples programmed with Shiny
